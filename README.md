# Halton Sampler

A very fast C++ implementation of the Halton sequence that supports both Faure-permutations and random digit permutations. Together with the component (i / N) this will yield a Hammersley point set. Comes with a Python script to generate optimized code for arbitrary dimensions. It also includes code to enumerate samples in a 2D domain, for example pixels.
